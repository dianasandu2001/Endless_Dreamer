# **Endless Dreamer**
by Diana Sandu

## **Summary**:
An endless runner game situated in the realm(s) of my future game called Dreamer. It includes different maps with their unique aesthetics and story. Inspired by Temple Run.

## **Core Mechanics**:
-	Running faster and faster as time passes
-	Jumping over obstacles
-	Collecting coins, gems, powerups and chests
-	Avoiding debuffs
-	Upgrading powerups
-	Purchasing new characters, cosmetics, and new maps

### **Hopeful Mechanics**:
- Quests
- Crafting System (for crafting one time use potions like score multiplier or extending a run)
- Achievements

## **Gameplay**:
The player would start on the default map and run, avoiding obstacles and debuffs while collecting coins, powerups, gems, and chests. The farther you run, the higher the distance count and the higher the score count (which can be increased with power-ups and multipliers).
Once the player trips twice consecutively or bumps into an object they would “wake up” and have to start the run again. This can be prevented with a second life with a potion, gems or maybe eventually adds.
Outside of the running, the user can upgrade the effectiveness and frequency of the powerups available during the run, buy more characters (and maybe cosmetics in the future), buy more maps, and craft potions with items acquired from chests.

Here is what the game looks like so far in its early stages:

## **Music**:
Fantasy music that fits the theme for them. The default map is a cool toned mystical mushroom-covered forest with exploration music. Other maps would include an indoor dungeon featuring creepier and more dangerous music and a map in the clouds with grand music.

## **Art Style**:
The art style is aimed to be somewhat realistic with a 3D cartoony feel to it. The scope is to have details to elevate the experience yet keep it feeling cozy and game-like. Inspired by Temple Run as well as World of Warcraft.

## **Aditional information**:

### **Lore of Dreamer**:
The game idea for the future to be "Dreamer" game is an open-world exploration game. The player would spawn in the "real world" and can discover places and meet NPC's. When the day comes to an end, they would need to return back to the in game home and go to bed, where the dream part of the game takes place. Depending on the places discovered and NPC's met. different places are unlocked and new storylines are opened. The different maps for the "Endless Dreamer" game are placed unlockable in the "Dreamer" world. I am hoping to add some easter eggs like rare collectibles or achievements with fragments of lore to piece it all together and once the "Dreamer" game is made, the players who played both can piece it together.
