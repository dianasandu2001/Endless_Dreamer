# **Endless Dreamer**
by Diana Sandu

## **Summary**:
An endless runner game situated in the realm(s) of my future game called Dreamer. It includes different maps with their own unique aesthetics and story. Inspired by temple run.

## **Core Mechanics**:
-	Running faster and faster as time passes
-	Jumping over obstacles
-	Collecting coins, gems, powerups and chests
-	Avoiding debuffs
-	Upgrading powerups
-	Purchasing new characters, cosmetics, and new maps

### **Hopeful Mechanics**:
- Quests
- Crafting System (for crafting one time use potions like score multiplier or extending a run)
- Achievements

## **Gameplay**:
You would start out on the default map and run, avoid obstacles and debuffs while collecting coins, powerups, gems, and chests. The farther you run, the higher the distance count and the higher the score count (which can be increased with power ups and multipliers)
One you trip twice consecutively, or bump into an object you would “wake up” and have to start the run again. This can be prevented with a second life with a potion, gems or maybe eventually adds.
Outside of the running, you can upgrade the effectiveness and frequency of the powerups that you can obtain, buy more characters (and maybe cosmetics in the future), buy more maps and craft potions with items acquired from chests.

## **Music**:
Fantasy music that fits the theme for them. The default map is cool toned mystical mushroom covered forest with exploration music. Other maps would include: an indoor dungeon featuring creeper and more dangerous music and a map in the clouds with more grand music.

## **Art Style**:
Fantasy 3D art. 
Shying away from realism with the scope of accessibility but not towards too few polygons since details are highly important for the fantasy aesthetic.
